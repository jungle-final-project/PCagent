# Agent AS Goal 4/5 status

Updated: 2026-07-02

## Member A scope

- Goal 4: Agent Register + Consent hardening
- Goal 5: Agent Heartbeat hardening
- This note records policy points that remain ambiguous in the project docs. No new feature behavior is introduced here.

## Confirmed current behavior

- `POST /api/agent/devices/register` is the only `/api/agent/**` endpoint allowed before Agent token authentication.
- `POST /api/agent/consents`, `POST /api/agent/heartbeat`, and `POST /api/agent/log-uploads` require an Agent bearer token.
- Agent mutation APIs require `Idempotency-Key`, including heartbeat under the current implementation.
- Register returns the raw agent token only in the response and stores only `agent_token_hash`.
- Log upload checks accepted `SERVER_UPLOAD` consent before creating upload/ticket rows.

## Need confirmation

- Register duplicate policy is not fully settled by the contract docs.
- Current MVP behavior refreshes the existing device token when the same user and `registrationIdempotencyKey` are reused.
- It is still unclear whether the same `activationToken` may register multiple devices.
- It is still unclear whether duplicate `deviceFingerprintHash` with a new `registrationIdempotencyKey` should create a new device, reject with conflict, or rotate the existing token.
- Consent update policy is not fully settled. Current behavior appends a consent row instead of updating an older row.
- API contract docs still list legacy web JWT paths such as `/api/agent/sessions` and `/api/agent-logs/upload`; they do not yet describe the current Agent-token lifecycle endpoints.
